# Contributing

Reference for the contributor workflow, build and validation commands, runtime debugging, and code conventions for working in `omnifs`. The repository-local architecture and design guidance lives in `AGENTS.md`; this file is the operational companion.

## Getting started

The primary contributor workflow is `just dev`, which runs `scripts/dev.ts`. The script builds providers and the native CLI, starts a host daemon, renders KCL desired resources, applies them with `target/debug/omnifs apply <file> --yes`, waits for the terminal revision, and opens a Filesystem shell inside `dev-docker` at `/omnifs`.

```bash
just dev            # build providers and the CLI, apply dev resources, wait for ready, open /omnifs
target/debug/omnifs status                     # host-native: runs directly, no docker exec needed
target/debug/omnifs fs shell dev-docker -- pwd # run one command at /omnifs in the guest
FILESYSTEM=$(docker ps --filter label=ai.0xff.omnifs.home="$HOME/.omnifs-dev" --format '{{.Names}}')
docker exec -it -w /omnifs "$FILESYSTEM" /bin/sh # reattach to the browsing shell
target/debug/omnifs fs rm dev-docker # request Docker runner teardown
target/debug/omnifs fs rm dev-host   # request host filesystem teardown
target/debug/omnifs down                       # stop the daemon
```

`scripts/dev.ts` is contributor-only and requires a source checkout. It resolves a dedicated profile at `~/.omnifs-dev`, compiles the CLI with the provider-store bundle embedded, renders a temporary or profile-local KCL desired config, sets host credentials through `target/debug/omnifs credential set --from-env`, and invokes `target/debug/omnifs apply <file> --yes`. It waits for the terminal revision before shell access and pins `[filesystem].docker_image` in `~/.omnifs-dev/config.toml` at an image tagged `omnifs-filesystem:<short-sha>-dev`. The daemon itself is host-native, not containerized: no home bind mount, no daemon container. Dev auth uses host tokens: set `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `LINEAR_API_KEY`, or allow the script to read `gh auth token` for GitHub when prompted. Authenticated mounts without a token are skipped rather than started broken.

A locally built `omnifs` binary targets the `omnifs-filesystem:dev` image by default and never pulls; produce that image with `just dev --build-only`, which builds providers, the CLI, and the filesystem image, tags it `omnifs-filesystem:dev`, and exits without starting a session.

Do not add alternate local mount recipes unless explicitly requested.

## Build and validate

Package selection uses cargo `-p` / `--exclude` globs (`omnifs-provider-*`, `test-provider`), not a hand-maintained crate list.

Host crates such as `omnifs-cli` and `omnifs-engine` build for the native target. Providers build directly as components with the Rust `wasm32-wasip2` target. `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2` emits provider component artifacts directly; WIT bindings are generated through the SDK.

Provider clippy and test commands must include `--target wasm32-wasip2` and `-p` globs:

```bash
cargo clippy -p 'omnifs-provider-*' -p test-provider --target wasm32-wasip2 -- -D warnings
cargo test -p 'omnifs-provider-*' -p test-provider --target wasm32-wasip2 --no-run
```

WASM tests compile but cannot execute on the host because there is no WASM runtime in the test harness. Use `--no-run` for target-specific provider compilation checks. Tests that need to run should use `#[cfg(test)]` with host-target-compatible code.

### CI and release builds

CI builds Rust artifacts natively and uses Docker only to assemble the optional filesystem image. Linux CLI artifacts use `cargo-zigbuild` with a GNU glibc 2.17 baseline. Darwin x64 cross-links from Linux through the pinned `rust-cross/cargo-zigbuild` container, while Darwin arm64 builds on a native Apple Silicon runner so it can stage and audit the pinned libkrun payload. Provider and tool WASM artifacts are built by `just build providers`; its WASI SDK pin in `justfile` is shared by local and CI builds.

`Dockerfile`'s `filesystem-dev` stage is the contributor image path for `just dev` (built by `scripts/dev.ts`, same as `just filesystem-image`). It runs `omnifs-thin --protocol fuse` (built by the `thin-builder` stage), which needs no engine runtime, Wasmtime, or provider bundle, so unlike the full `omnifs` CLI/daemon binary (`OMNIFS_PROVIDER_BUNDLE_DIR` embeds `just build providers`'s `target/omnifs-provider-store` output into that binary at compile time), the filesystem image needs no provider-wasm build context at all. Release filesystem image assembly uses `scripts/ci/build-filesystem-image.sh`, which stages a prebuilt Linux `omnifs-thin` binary rather than compiling in Docker. Release CLI binaries embed the compressed provider bundle and unpack it into the host `OMNIFS_HOME/providers`; do not make the image the owner of `/root/.omnifs/providers`. Keep `just dev` working when changing Docker-related files.

CI orchestration shells live in `scripts/ci/`, with `scripts/ci/common.sh` factoring out repo-root discovery. Npm version sync is a just recipe. The release flow is git-cliff plus the `release-pr.yml` coordinator (see `RELEASING.md`); Bun runs contributor and benchmark tooling, not release orchestration.

## Validate through the live runtime

For mount, provider, clone, traversal, or runtime behavior changes, do not stop at Rust-only checks. Validate through the supported runtime path:

```bash
just dev -y
target/debug/omnifs status
target/debug/omnifs --output json status | jq '.result | {filesystems, mounts, providers, credentials}'
FILESYSTEM=$(docker ps --filter label=ai.0xff.omnifs.home="$HOME/.omnifs-dev" --format '{{.Names}}')
docker exec "$FILESYSTEM" sh -c 'ls /omnifs/github/0xff-ai/omnifs/issues/open'
tail -n 80 ~/.omnifs-dev/daemon-state/logs/daemon.log
```

`scripts/ci/smoke-native-filesystem.sh` is the standalone equivalent CI's `smoke-amd64`/`smoke-arm64` jobs run: it starts its own throwaway dev home (not `~/.omnifs-dev`), reads real GitHub data through both the host mount path and a `docker exec` into the filesystem container, and tears everything down again. Run it directly with `FILESYSTEM_IMAGE=omnifs-filesystem:dev GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) scripts/ci/smoke-native-filesystem.sh` instead of the block above when you want a scripted pass/fail rather than a session to poke at.

For provider path-surface changes, test the whole shell traversal, not only the intended leaf paths. In the live container, run `ll`, `cd`, and `find` from the provider root through every intermediate directory. Verify that parent directories do not synthesize duplicate root entries, route scaffolding names do not bind as dynamic captures, and control directories do not contain paper/item nodes unless the design explicitly says they should.

## Runtime debugging

- The daemon is host-native: its raw log is `~/.omnifs-dev/daemon-state/logs/daemon.log` on the host, not inside any container.
- `docker logs "$FILESYSTEM"` shows the filesystem container's own stdout/stderr; it only ever runs `omnifs-thin --protocol fuse`, so a mount-serving failure is almost always in the daemon log instead.
- Clone failures should surface in the daemon log with `git clone` stderr.
- FUSE `access(...)` warnings are expected noise unless they correlate with a real failure.
- Use `target/debug/omnifs status` directly (host-native, no `docker exec` needed) for fast mount/config/provider/cache triage.
- Use `target/debug/omnifs inspect` for the live TUI, or add `--plain` when capturing the typed activity as lines.
- The filesystem container is credential-free and carries no `OMNIFS_HOME`: `docker exec` into it only ever sees `/omnifs`, never host paths or credentials.

When a repo path returns `Input/output error`, check:

1. `tail -n 80 ~/.omnifs-dev/daemon-state/logs/daemon.log`
2. SSH auth on the host (the daemon runs host-native, not in a container)
3. whether the mount is still present (`mount | grep omnifs` on Linux; `target/debug/omnifs status` on macOS)

When debugging hangs or slow paths, start with user-visible probes before theory:

1. `cd /github/<owner>`
2. `cat /dns/@google/<domain>/MX`
3. `tail -n 80 ~/.omnifs-dev/daemon-state/logs/daemon.log`

The filesystem image is a minimal `debian:trixie-slim` (GNU coreutils/findutils, fuse3, jq, rsync, tar, xxd; `Dockerfile`'s `filesystem-base`), deliberately without zsh, gum, or any shell rc customization: it only ever runs `omnifs-thin --protocol fuse`, and an interactive session there is `/bin/sh`. Do not add interactive-shell tooling to it; that belongs to the host shell the contributor already has.

## Code conventions

### Rust type conversions

Prefer `From` and `TryFrom` at type boundaries instead of `foo_to_bar` free functions when the conversion is a true one-to-one mapping.

Keep free functions when:

- orphan rules block a cross-crate impl, for example `credential_entry_from_token` from an oauth2 token to `omnifs_auth::CredentialEntry`
- extra context is required, for example `io_context_into(context, error)` or `push_projected_file_content(records, path, file)`
- the helper is callout-specific extraction for `CalloutFuture`, meaning `fn(CalloutResult) -> Result<T>`. Do not use `TryFrom<CalloutResult>` for single-variant unwraps.
- the mapping is conditional or formatting-only, for example HTTP `status_error` with 429 and `retry-after` handling

When orphan rules block `From<A> for B`, use a local newtype in the owning crate, for example `WitHeaders(&HeaderMap)` in `omnifs-sdk/src/http.rs`, rather than a conversion helper that hides the same logic.

In `omnifs-sdk`, `Result<T>` aliases `core::result::Result<T, ProviderError>`. `TryFrom` impls must return `std::result::Result<_, ProviderError>` explicitly.

Host-only error enums may be supersets of WIT/guest types. For example, host `ExtractError` adds `SandboxTrapped` and setup failures. Do not re-export guest bindgen types as the host public error; map with `From` at the boundary.

Existing conversion hubs: `crates/omnifs-engine/src/callouts/wit_convert.rs`, `crates/omnifs-sdk/src/file_attrs.rs`, `crates/omnifs-sdk/src/browse.rs`, and `crates/omnifs-engine/src/callouts/{blob,git,archive}.rs`.
