omnifs is a filesystem projection system. It projects external systems into a
shared virtual namespace that can be exposed to an OS as one or more
filesystems. GitHub, DNS, arXiv, Docker, Linear, SQLite, Kubernetes, web pages,
and Oura become directories and files you can `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `grep`,
`find`, `jq`, and script against.

The goal is simple: if a tool can read files, it can read the outside world without learning another SDK, auth flow, pagination model, or response schema.

> Alpha status: omnifs is real and usable, but the read surface is still early. The daemon runs natively on Linux and macOS. Named Filesystems are independent whole-namespace access surfaces managed with `omnifs fs`. Docker and libkrun deliver FUSE only. Filesystems attach over the wire protocol and carry no providers or credentials.

## Quickstart

omnifs is written in Rust. We ship prebuilt Linux and macOS binaries through the npm registry, so the npm installation path needs Node.js and npm. Docker or OrbStack is needed only for the optional Docker-hosted FUSE filesystem; macOS can use libkrun instead.

```bash
npm install -g @0xff-ai/omnifs
omnifs setup
omnifs status
```

`omnifs setup` boots the host-native daemon, shows what is already running, and lists every embedded provider with honest auth and config labels. It then offers two default-yes confirms: create resources for every provider that needs no sign-in, and add the platform-recommended Filesystem. `--yes` accepts both without asking; `--no-input` declines both and still exits 0. Anything that needs a sign-in or a config value goes through `omnifs mount add`.

---

Interactive commands edit the desired resource set, show the daemon plan, ask for consent, apply, and follow typed progress. For automation, use KCL with `omnifs plan <file>` and `omnifs apply <file> --yes`; set secrets only with `credential set --from-env`. Mounts, credentials, provider artifacts, and Filesystems are daemon-owned state changed through local typed RPC.

```bash
omnifs provider add
omnifs mount add
omnifs mount update github
omnifs fs add
omnifs status --follow
```

---

Useful commands:

```bash
omnifs status      # resources and desired/observed phases
omnifs fs ls # configured Filesystems and runtime state
omnifs logs -f     # follow daemon logs
omnifs inspect     # live TUI for namespace, provider, cache, and callout activity
omnifs status --follow --action <action-id>
omnifs down        # stop the daemon
```

Filesystem resources persist as desired state. Host locations must be absolute; Docker and libkrun own their guest location. Resource presence requests a filesystem, and removal requests teardown.

```bash
omnifs fs add
omnifs fs restart guest
omnifs fs shell guest
omnifs fs shell guest -- ls -la /omnifs/github
omnifs fs rm guest
```

Every Filesystem exposes every configured mount. `omnifs provider add` resolves and retains one exact content-addressed provider artifact; import grants no authority. The planner validates the Mount before serving it.

`omnifs mount update NAME` collects named auth, config, or limits fields, shows the complete desired-state diff, and applies an exact base revision. A stale plan fails without an automatic retry.

For automation, select one invocation-owned output contract. JSON prints one envelope and keeps resource collections plural; JSONL uses the same terminal result or error envelope with its stream-record discriminator. Live logs and Inspector records remain line streams.

```bash
omnifs --output json status | jq '.result.filesystems[] | {name, phase, desiredRevision, observedRevision}'
omnifs --output json mount ls | jq '.result.mounts[]'
```

On an interactive terminal, `omnifs inspect` shows a timestamped operation stream, path activity, per-mount rates, and the selected provider/cache/callout stages. Press `?` for the current keys. `omnifs inspect --plain` emits human lines and `omnifs --output jsonl inspect` emits typed records without opening terminal mode.

## Things to try

Once you are inside any filesystem mount, use normal shell tools.

```bash
# GitHub
cd /github/ollama/ollama
ls
cat repo.json
cat issues/open/12959/title
cat pulls/all/9585/diff.patch
# repository trees are cloned on demand
cd repo && ls

# DNS
cat /dns/cloudflare.com/A
cat /dns/@google/google.com/AAAA
cat /dns/openai.com/TXT
cat /dns/reverse/1.1.1.1

# arXiv -- "Attention is all you need"
ls /arxiv/papers/1706.03762
cat /arxiv/papers/1706.03762/@latest/paper.json | jq .title

# Docker
cat /docker/system/version.json | jq .
cat /docker/containers.json | jq .
ls /docker/containers/running

# Linear -- requires a Linear API key
ls /linear/teams
cat /linear/teams/ENG/issues/open/ENG-123/title

# SQLite -- download an example db and explore the data
wget -O /tmp/chinook.sqlite https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/raw/refs/heads/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite
omnifs provider add # select the embedded db provider
omnifs mount add    # select db and provide path: /tmp/chinook.sqlite
ls /db/tables
cat /db/tables/Album/schema.sql
cat /db/tables/Album/sample.json | jq .
```

Check the host before opening repo tree paths:

```bash
echo "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
ssh-add -L
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Why paths

APIs are good boundaries for applications. They are a bad default interface for every script, terminal session, CI job, editor, and agent that only needs to read state.

omnifs makes the path the interface:

```text
/github/ollama/ollama/issues/open/12959/title
/docker/containers/running/{name}/state
/arxiv/papers/1706.03762/@latest/paper.json
/dns/cloudflare.com/TXT
```

That gives existing tools a common substrate. `grep -r`, `find`, `jq`, `tar`, `diff`, `head`, `tail`, and editors can all operate without provider-specific clients. Agents get the same benefit: open a path and read bytes.

The projected namespace is read-only. Mount commands change daemon-owned state through local RPC; projected issue, PR, container, and DNS files are never direct mutation controls.

## How it works

The host-native daemon owns providers, credentials, caching, callouts, and one shared namespace. FUSE and NFS filesystems in host, Docker, or libkrun runtimes all expose that same tree via the wire protocol.

```text
                                                                  +----------------+
+-------------+          +-----------------------------+          | github.wasm    | -> GitHub
| shell, app, | FUSE/NFS |        omnifs daemon        | callouts | dns.wasm       | -> DoH
| CI, agent   | <------> | /github /dns /arxiv ...     | <------> | docker.wasm    | -> Docker socket
|             |  files   | cache, auth, git, network   |          | linear.wasm    | -> Linear
+-------------+          +-----------------------------+          +----------------+
```

Providers are WebAssembly components implementing the [`omnifs:provider` WIT interface](crates/omnifs-wit/wit/provider.wit). Providers are self-contained: they declare identity, capabilities, config metadata, and auth via `#[omnifs_sdk::provider]` annotations, which the build assembles into the `omnifs.provider-metadata.v1` Wasm custom section. A provider's main job is to answer filesystem operations via entrypoint methods `lookup_child`, `list_children`, and `read_file`.

Providers do not hold tokens, open sockets, or run Git themselves. They await typed host callouts such as HTTP fetches, blob downloads, archive opens, or repo tree handoffs. The host executes those imports, attaches credentials at the boundary, enforces declared capabilities, and owns caching.

The cache is host-owned plain byte storage. Providers can return canonical upstream bytes and derived filesystem entries together, so one upstream payload can populate multiple files and child entries. Invalidations come from explicit provider effects and runtime events.

## Development workflows

Use `just dev` when working from this repository. It builds provider WASM and the native CLI, renders KCL desired resources under `~/.omnifs-dev`, starts the host-native daemon and fixtures, applies that resource set, waits for the terminal revision, and opens a Filesystem shell at `/omnifs`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xff-ai/omnifs
cd omnifs
just dev -y
# opens the attached filesystem shell at /omnifs
```

Refresh generated and formatted artifacts:

```bash
just refresh
```

For runtime behavior, validate through the host daemon and attached filesystem:

```bash
just dev -y
target/debug/omnifs status
tail -n 80 ~/.omnifs-dev/daemon-state/logs/daemon.log
```

## Current status

- FUSE (Linux) and read-only NFSv4 loopback (macOS) filesystems in host, Docker, or libkrun runtimes; exposed through daemon-owned Filesystem resources.
- A host CLI on npm that handles mounts, auth, lifecycle, logs, status, and inspection.
- Sandboxed Wasm providers that can only reach the network, Git, sockets, and files the host hands them.
- Host-held credentials, layered caching, and `omnifs inspect` for a live view of what the runtime is doing.
- Daemon-owned SQLite state and typed local RPC for mounts, credentials, providers, logs, and filesystems.
- Nine live providers: GitHub, DNS, arXiv, Docker, Linear, SQLite, Kubernetes, Web, and Oura.
